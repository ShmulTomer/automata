Higher Priority:
- initial state functionality
- no mid air arrows
- how to handle name? 
    - give each node a counter label, and use the name separately?
- 


Lower Priority:
- adjust angle anchor values
- add color changing feature
- adjust self links and links look
- clean up codebase
- add DNS 
- check UNC and add add'l func (right arrow, etc.)
- make sure backup and cookies work! (like with new properties and colors)
- disable the drawing too
- clear everything button
- make sure symbols work correctly (add $$ around them)

Misc:
, every state/.style={fill,draw=none,orange,text=white,circular drop shadow}

Blue, Green, Orange, Red 




To Do:
- fix arcs 
- fix self loops
- handle changes with new package
    - name vs text field
    - can two nodes have the same name? maybe diff. b/w text and name 
    - can nodes have no name?



two nodes can't have same name
all nodes must have names
